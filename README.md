What is FDO?
-The FAIR Digital Object Framework (FDOF) is a framework which defines a model to represent objects in a digital environment and a mechanism to create, maintain and (re)use these objects . The framework consists of a predictable identifier resolution behaviour, a mechanism to retrieve the object's metadata and an object typing system. The main goal of the FDOF is to define a set of features to provide foundational support for the FAIR principles.[1]
